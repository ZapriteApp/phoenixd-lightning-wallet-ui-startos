# Instructions for Phoenixd Lightning Wallet UI

1. **Start service and Click `Launch UI`** to access your personal already set-up Phoenixd Lightning Wallet interface.

2. **Back Up Your Wallet**: Go to **Settings** and securely back up your wallet seed. This is essential for recovering your wallet and accessing your funds in the future. Refresh page to view seed if needed.

3. **Deposit Funds**: Deposit an amount beyond the **[fee credit sats](https://phoenix.acinq.co/server/auto-liquidity)** to display a balance. Small payments during bootstrapping may be used to purchase inbound liquidity and deducted from future fees.


> **Note**: Keep your **HTTP password** private, as it can be used to access your wallet node.

> **Note**: Amounts below **fee credit sats** will not show as balance.
